This version optimizes the borrower's borrowing check-in process, 
specifies the borrowing time as the current date, and the return time as the borrowing date plus a specific time (such as 7 days or 14 days), 
and adds a dedicated footer. 
The next plan is to add a user authentication system to the website, 
such as administrators and borrowers. 
Administrators can use all website functions, 
while borrowers can only borrow and search data and cannot modify the data.
In terms of web page aesthetics, 
in the future we may make certain modifications to the layout of the edit and delete buttons on the list page to improve the overall aesthetics.
