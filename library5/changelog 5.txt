This version adds a significant amount of new functionality to the online library website. 
First, I added a new login system. Since regular visitors shouldn't have the ability to modify or delete borrowed items, 
I restructured the original separate borrow list page into a guest and administrator version. 
The guest version retains only basic query functionality, 
while the administrator version grants access to modify, edit, and delete borrowed items. 
Login is handled by newly added login and logout screens. 
The basic login username is "admin" and the password is "admin123." 
To implement this login functionality, I used flask login, which led to significant changes to the underlying backend code. 
I moved database generation to config.py, added login code to auth.py, and added login and logout code to main.py. 
Future plans include adding library book data, images, and descriptions to the about.html page to facilitate borrowing by book ID. 
Since the previous CSS is insufficient to support the new features, I may also update and update the overall CSS.
