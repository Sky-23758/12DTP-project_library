This version of the online library is an update to the previous one. 
It uses some simple AI-generated CSS for simple decoration, 
with a predominantly blue colour scheme. 
I've also added a brief introduction to the "about" page. 
Available features include: 1. Book borrowing form; 2. Data upload; 3. Querying, modifying, and deleting borrowing records. 
Since modifying and deleting borrowing records shouldn't be accessible to ordinary users, 
I may implement some restrictions in the future, such as adding administrators.
