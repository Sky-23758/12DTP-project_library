This version of the library website was modified by me based on my teacher's pizza subscription website. 
Most of the content is similar to the pizza subscription website. 
This version of the website does not use a lot of CSS for decoration. 
There is no content in the about interface. 
There are also some problems with the code of the borrow page. 
Among them, the selection of borrowing time cannot be confirmed, which may need to be improved in the future.
